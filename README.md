# ulauncher-elementary
ULauncher configuration and icons for elementary OS

# Installation

1. Download and install the ULauncher .deb file from https://ulauncher.io/#Download
2. Rename the shortcuts.json file in the ~/.config/ulauncher directory (i.e. shortcuts.json.bak). **You may need this if things go south or if you need to merge shortcuts you created with the new file**.
3. Download the ulauncher-elementary.zip file and extract it into the ~/.config/ulauncher directory (.config is in your home directory)
6. Reboot

**NOTE**: If you replace the shortcuts.json file with the file in this repo (as instructed) you will lose any shortcuts you created. You can merge the file you backed up with the file in this repo if you would like shortcuts from each.
