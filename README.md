# ulauncher-elementary
ULauncher configuration and icons for elementary OS

# Installation

1. Download and install the ULauncher .deb file from https://ulauncher.io/#Download
2. Download the icons.zip file and extract it into the ~/.config/ulauncher directory (.config is in your home directory)
3. Rename the shortcuts.json file in the ~/.config/ulauncher directory as a backup (i.e. shortcuts.json.bak)
4. Download and copy the shortcuts.json file into the ~/.config/ulauncer directory
5. Reboot

NOTE: If you replace the shortcuts.json file with the file in this repo (as instructed) you will lose any shortcuts you created. You can merge the file you backed up with the file in this repo if you would like shortcuts from each.
